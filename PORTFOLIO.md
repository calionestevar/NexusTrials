# NexusTrials - Portfolio Overview

**10-year QA automation veteran bringing enterprise testing practices to game development.**

## The Ask
Show game studios that professional-grade test frameworks and AI validation can solve gaming's biggest quality challenges—just like they do in healthcare, agtech, and marine systems.

## What You're Looking At

### The Game
A lightweight Unreal Engine 5.7 project with **3 playable variants** that intentionally keeps gameplay simple so the **testing framework is the star**.

### The Framework Integration
- **NexusQA**: Automated test orchestration (your proprietary framework)
- **Distributed Testing**: Multi-server load testing and chaos injection
- **AI Validation**: Behavior verification and anomaly detection
- **Compliance**: Medical/automotive-grade testing patterns adapted for games

## Why This Matters

| Background | Applied To Games |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Cerner (5 yrs)** - DICOM/medical imaging validation | → Game server/backend testing |
| **AGI SureTrack (2 yrs)** - Cypress automation (agtech) | → Game client/UI automation |
| **Garmin (2+ yrs)** - Network resilience (marine) | → Game network chaos engineering |

## Quick Stats

✅ **Clean UE 5.7 build** - All modules compiling, linking, running  
✅ **Framework integrated** - NexusQA submodule properly configured  
✅ **Professional setup** - CI/CD ready with headless testing support  
✅ **Portfolio-grade code** - Real game systems (health, AI, physics) not toy examples  

## Next Steps (Testing Phase)

1. ✅ Project builds cleanly
2. 🔄 **Launch game & verify gameplay** - Confirm all 3 variants playable
3. 🔄 **Create test scenario** - E.g., "automated character health validation"
4. 🔄 **Wire NexusQA** - Add debug menu calling framework functions
5. 🔄 **Document findings** - Test results, framework insights, lessons learned

## For Hiring Managers
